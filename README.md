# Cloning Superinvestors

## Description
*This project aims to clone the operations of different recognized value investors in order to evaluate their performance. This can be achieved since the information of the quarterly operations of investors such as Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger or David Tepper are disclosed to the public through the $13$-F filings. However, it should be clarified that such operations, which only include the purchase and sale of shares, will be carried out with a delay of $45$ days, since this is the period that must pass from the end of any quarter for the information to be revealed. The ultimate goal of the project is to answer the following question: can good returns be obtained by cloning the operations of superinvestors even when the information arrives with a certain delay?.*
